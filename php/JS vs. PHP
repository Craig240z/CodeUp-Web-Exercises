JS vs. PHP

JS gets input and puts output in the browser, after the page loads
JS is client language == language of the browser

PHP accepts inputs heading to the server
PHP produces output on the server
PHP produces output for the browser (render HTML)
===================

PHP render HTML to browser
browser show HTML
JS handles behavior and interactivity IN the browser

var data = {
    "name": "Ryan",
    "languages": [
    'HTML',
    'CSS']
}


conditonals in JS - 
    - outcome of something
    - if checkbox is checked
    - check the state of elements in the DOM
    - check properties of given elements or matched elements
    - filtering data
    - make decisions based on criteria in the if statement
    - condition of things in the DOM, state of things, sttributes
    - events - onload, click, keydown, keypress, focus, unfocus...

conditional in PHP (or any server side language)
true && true   t
true && false  

PHP - Server Side language
    Conditionals -
        - Respond to requests (GET, POST)
        - Access Databases
        - read/write files .txt, .csv
        - 

Keep this front of mind:
- Anything you can echo with PHP, you can echo onto HTML
- Most syntax is the same for PHP as JS
    - if, else, elseif
    - loops
    - function definitions
- Feelings
    - WTF, JS?
    - fundamentals
    - 

<p class="name"> <?php echo $name; ?> </p>
